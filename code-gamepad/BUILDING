To build the firmware, download JALv2 with JALLIB from http://code.google.com/p/jallib/

jallib-pack-2.4p-0.9.0.zip was used for building this version.

On my Mac, the following command line invocation was used to compile, run from the Terminal in the compiler directory in the expanded JALLIB pack:

./jalv2osx -long-start -s ../lib /path/to/nesverter.jal -loader18 -no-fuse
